# Architexa

Architexa is a diagramming tool that uses code-dependencies to quickly create diagrams. The tool is currently distributed as an Eclipse plug-in and the code includes a Java parser.

## Project Structure
Core plugins are available in the `client` directory with specific Eclipse compatability support in `compat/3.x` and `compat/4.x` (use one or the other). Extensions are additional plugins that provide support and integration with subverson and spring. Eclipse feature definition and update site subprojects are in `releng`.
