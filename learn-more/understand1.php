<h1>Understand with Familiar Diagrams</h1>

<p>Do you feel you spend a lot of time in understanding code? Have you or your colleagues ever had a difficult time when asked to review each other’s code but find it hard to “read” unfamiliar code? Have you even forget the logical of your own code written long ago and forced to spend time on your own code?</p>

<p>We at Architexa believes the challenge with making sense of projects is in connecting related parts of the code together - something that diagrams are great for.</p>

<p>We have built support for the most common types of diagrams created today. 
We want you to be able to create layered diagrams, class diagrams, and sequence diagrams as easily as possible.</p>

<h4>Intuitive Understanding with the three types of Diagrams</h4>

<div style="float:right">
	<a href="/images/landing/landing-diagrams"  rel="prettyPhoto" title="Combining using of Three Types of Diagrams"><img src="/images/landing/landing-diagrams" width="300" border="0" /></a>
	
</div>

<p>By using different type of diagrams according to the specific task, you can dramatically save the time spent in understanding code. Now, regardless you are required to get high level overview of your code or analysis certain part in detail, you can all get it done quickly and easily with the help of Architexa.</p>

<p>Further more, all the diagrams created by Architexa are high interactive. By adding, moving,  reordering or focusing, you can ensure the information provided is up-to-date and relevant to current tasks.</p>

<p>With the combinational use of three diagrams and interact with them, understanding code would become a quick and easy work.</p>


<h4>Build diagrams while coding, and go from:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Unwieldy multiple tabs to a single class diagram</li>
<li>Stack traces to sequence diagrams</li>
<li>Large new codebases to layered architecture diagrams</li>
</ul>
