<h1>The Challenge For Developers - Understanding Code</h1>

<p>In study after study the results have been consistent: <b>programmers spend a 
large amount of their time making sense of code.</b> This is true whether the code was written by other team members or by the programmer himself just 4 months 
ago.</p>

<h1>Code Understanding is a Large Problem</h1>
<p style="margin:-10px 0pt 5pt 0px;">Whether it is understanding complex code, understanding code that was written by someone who just left the team, understanding new code when moving onto a new project, or just understanding code that was written by oneself just 3-4 months ago - making sense of code has been known to be a big challenge for software developers. There have been a number of studies that have been conducted by researchers studying developers' coding needs. Below are some of the major results.</p>

<h1>Where Tools Have Failed</h1>


<p>The challenge when using most tools has been that they are hard to use, 
almost as hard as comprehending the code. Tools have traditionally focused either on the needs of designers and modellers by providing significant support for generating code from UML diagrams or on the needs of software architects by providing powerful technology that requires significant training.</p>

<p>Architexa provides a suite that supports an intuitive but powerful interface to UML diagramming by giving users an interactive exploratory visualization platform.</p>
