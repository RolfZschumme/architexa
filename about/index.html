<h1>The Company</h1>
<img style="border:0; margin:0px 20px; padding:5px;float:right;" src="http://www.architexa.com/images/logo-icon.png">
<p style="text-align: justify;">Architexa is an MIT spin-off formed in Summer 2007. We are based in
Cambridge, Mass. and are a small driven team of programmers
who believe that better tools can make it easier to grasp code.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Our experience with building software engineering analysis tools has
highlighted to us the need for building intuitive tools for software developers
and applying both artificial intelligence and information retrieval (search)
techniques in the background. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We built our first tool in 2000 when working for Microsoft's large Office
Suite.  After building prototypes for providing a view into detailed structural
elements in code and working with a few teams, our approach was refined as part
of a PhD dissertation at MIT's Computer Science and Artificial Intelligent
Lab.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We have since worked for Accenture Research Labs to provide high-level views
of code with great success. More recently Architexa has worked for Progress
Software to help build graphical tooling for Enterprise Integration
Patterns.</p>
