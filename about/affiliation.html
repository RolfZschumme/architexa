The Eclipse Project was created by IBM in November 2001 and subsequently 
moved to a non-profit foundation. Eclipse has since gained significant industry 
adoption to become the IDE of choice for most Java developers and has become a 
platform for multiple companies to collaborate and innovate. Companies that 
currently build IDEs on top of Eclipse include Adobe, Aptana, Borland, 
Emarcadero, IBM, SAP, and Zend.
<br><br>
At Architexa, we are an active contributor to the Eclipse community. We have 
spoken at EclipseCon since 2007 and are contributors to the next generation 
Eclipse platform (e4).

A clear software architecture can help developers and team members have a 
coherent view of their project. The International Association of Software 
Architects (IASA) focuses on the advancements of such best practices to IT 
Architects around the world. At Architexa, our vision of helping developers 
gain an understanding of the software architecture serves the same purpose - helping software architects.
