To accomplish this:</p><ol><li>Hold ctrl and select any number of items in the diagram. </li><li>Once the items you are interested in are selected, right click and go to 'Open in Diagram'</li><li>You can now select which diagram type you would like to view the selected items in. </li><li>If an item is grayed out, it means that you have selected an element that can not be opened in that diagram. For instance a method or field can not be opened in a Layered diagram and a package cannot be opened in a Sequence Diagram.</li></ol><p><img width="400" border="0" src="images/LayerToClass.png"/></p><h2 id="Switch_between_a_Sequence_Diagram_and_a_Class_Diagram">Switch between a Sequence Diagram and a Class Diagram</h2><p>If you are exploring items in a class diagram and there are a lot of calls between different methods it can be difficult to understand what order calls are made in. In this case switching to a sequence diagram can be helpful. To accomplish this simply </p><ol><li>Find the 'Switch Diagram Type' button in the toolbar</li><li>Select either 'Sequence Diagram'  or 'Class Diagram.'</li></ol><p><img border="0" src="images/Switch_dropdown.PNG"/></p><p>					---- Your question not answered?
