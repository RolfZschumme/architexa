<h1>Class Diagrams
</h1>

<p>Programmers often get stuck tracing a large number of code connections as 
projects become more and more complex.  While code for any one feature would 
ideally all be in one place, this is often not the case. 
</p>
<p>
As new features are added 
to a system, it can become hard to prevent the code from becoming split among 
multiple locations. Architexa's class diagrams can help by <b>bringing spread out code 
together</b>.</p>

, leading to frustration and further deviation from the core problem affecting the overall productivity.

		Architexa creates class diagrams to help you discover related
		classes, methods, and fields and shows you various code
		relationships like inheritance, method calls, and call references. 
	</p>
	<p>
	Architexa's class diagrams also make 
		it easier for you to <b>see the structure</b> of code you care
		about in a single view.<a href="{{site.baseurl}}/learn-more/videos/class-diagrams/index.php">

		<h2>Simple start</h2>
	<p>
		It is easy for typical diagrams to quickly get too large to be helpful, but Architexa 
		helps you keep control of what is shown in a diagram. 
	</p>
		<p>
		Class diagrams start simple from a single method, field, or a class, and while diagrams allow you to easily add members, nothing is added unless you want it.

		<h2>Intuitive representation</h2>
	<p>	A familiar UML-like representation and standard Eclipse icons allow for 
		easy identification of components. 
		</p>
		<p>Also, information is presented in an intuitive manner and ideas are communicated using visual cues. 
	</p>
	<p>
		For example, selecting a class displays vertical arrows at its top and bottom that indicate what the class inherits from (implements or extends) or what inherits from it; and similarly, calls made by or calls made to a method in a class are shown by horizontal arrows.

		<h2>Conquer tabs</h2>

		Having too many editors open happens often and gets 
		annoying fast. 
		</p>
		<p>
		When you're juggling with many tabs and can't tell which ones you care about, or when you're lost in your code and can't figure out what part of the codebase the tabs represent, Architexa allows you to pull all open tabs together in a single diagram. 
		</p>
		<p>
		You'll get an overview of the code you've recently looked at or worked with and see how all the open tabs are related.
