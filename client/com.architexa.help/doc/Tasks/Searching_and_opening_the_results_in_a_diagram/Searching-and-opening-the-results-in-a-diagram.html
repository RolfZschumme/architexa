It is often desirable to determine the significance or impact of a specific term or variable across a codebase. To create a diagram of such a term follow these steps:</p><ol><li>Perform a search using eclipse (Search menu -&gt; Search...) <br/></li><li>Remove any results that are not relevant to your search</li><li>In the resulting Search view toolbar, notice the Architexa dropdown. <br/><img width="500" border="0" src="images/Search_dropdown_hover.PNG"/></li><li>Click the down arrow on the Architexa dropdown and select a type of diagram to open the search results in. <br/><img width="500" border="0" src="images/Search_dropdown_menu.PNG"/></li></ol><p>Note: 
To avoid the generated diagram becoming unmanageably cluttered when the number of search results is large, the amount of information in the diagram is limited to the most important and relevant classes, i.e., those recently navigated, in open java editors, and with the most search matches. Therefore, regardless of the number of search results:</p><ul><li>A class diagram generated from search results will contain at most 20 classes.</li><li>A sequence diagram generated from search results will contain at most 6 classes.</li><li>The number of classes in a layered diagram will not be limited; it will contain every class present in the search results.</li></ul><p>					---- Your question not answered?
