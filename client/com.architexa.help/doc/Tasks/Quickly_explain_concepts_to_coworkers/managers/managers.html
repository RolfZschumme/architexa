Architexa provide a great means for explaining features, code concepts, or architecture to co-workers, managers, or business folk especially when they can not be in the same room with you. </p><p>While this can be accomplished with screen sharing, tele-conferencing, or endless meetings and emails, Architexa can accomplish this much faster, with more accuracy, and help create lasting documentation at the same time.</p><ol><li>First create one or more diagrams documenting the concept you would like to explain (see documenting code concepts tips)<ol><li>Use a Layered Diagram if you are explaining a high level Architectural concept and want to show the dependencies between packages</li><li>Use a Class diagram if you want to highlight the hierarchy of a specific class(s) or want to show how a number of classes/methods call eachother and interact.</li><li>Use a Sequence Diagram to describe the details of a specific method or class. </li></ol></li><li>Once you have one or more diagrams you can easily share it via email or upload it to our server to make it accessible to others in the future.
