<h1>Easily Document, Share, and Discuss Code Features</h1>

<p>
Coding is an iterative process, and keeping track of changes therefore becomes important yet difficult. Architexa allows you to take snapshots of your work that are readily accessible for reference. Worried that you won't remember all the details of a feature after a few months? Easily store diagrams containing these details and access them whenever you need to.</p>


<p>We understand that your time is valuable, so Architexa provides a toolbar menu directly inside Eclipse that lets you share diagrams with a single click or find and view any existing diagram with ease.</p>

		<h2>Mentor New Developers Effectively</h2>
		Explaining code to a new developer is a time consuming process, and key components can easily be omitted by the mentor or forgotten by the new developer. Help new team members remember feature details by creating diagrams and sharing them.

		<h2>Collaborate with Distributed Teams</h2>
			Do you have team members working in multiple locations? Imagine if the next time you explained something to one team member, everyone in the team could also be involved and easily understand it. Create diagrams of relevant components and store them on our server. Diagrams become available 24/7 and can be accessed when needed from any part of the world.

		<h2>Code Reviews Taking Time?</h2>
		Notes you made while implementing a feature could be helpful to someone else maintaining the code. Create a diagram of code that someone else needs to review, and they can use it to get an idea of the main components before diving into the code details.

		<h2>Share Main Design Components</h2>
		Tired of explaining the same feature description to everyone? Create a diagram once and place it on the collaboration server for others to see. Architexa's collaboration tool lets you share a design easily with just a single-click, making the design available to team members in real-time.

		<h2>Automatically Find Related Diagrams</h2>
		Can't find high-level documentation for the codebase that you are looking at? Architexa intelligently finds related diagrams for you automatically. As you explore your code, you can get a complete list of diagrams related to the code that you are seeing, and can easily examine them.
