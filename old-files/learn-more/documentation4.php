<h1> Documentation </h1>
<p>Are you finding it difficult to create more than just API documentation for your source code? Do you find needing to write pages and pages of text to describe your project?Are you spending a lot of time trying to put together architecture diagrams in drawing tools like Paint, Word, or Visio? Are you finding your UML tools not providing much help with the code that you already have?? Would you like to be able to create documentation instantly, that is up-to-date and built from
?</p>
<p>We at Architexa have created a next-gen documentation tool that puts the fun back into documentation using diagrams that can be annotated with your comments. With a click of a button, you can create <b> simplified UML diagrams </b> that describe your code either at a very high-level or at the lowest level. You can also keep generating diagrams as your code changes so that your documentation is always up-to-date!</p>
<h2>Pictures instead of text</h2>
<p>Finding it difficult to document every part of the code in form of text?  Architexa helps you come up with architectural representations using a single click. The diagrams that are created not only help you understand your code better but also act as the documentation for the code that can be accessed by any of your team member.</p>
<h2>Document Instantly</h2>
<p>Wasting a lot of time on documentation? Axchitexa allows you to <b>add</b> and <b>edit notes </b> right next to the diagram as it gets generated. These notes get saved along with the diagrams on the <b>Architexa server</b> and can be accessed by your team member whenever they want to refresh a particular program or use it as a reference for an on going project.</p>
<h2>Anybody can do it</h2>
<p>Having a hard time in finding a developer to create documentation for a particular section of code?Architexa allows a lightweight low-commitment approach for developers using a piece of code users build the documentation. Anyone can improve documentation and the popular diagrams can be reviewed by the core-developers for accuracy before including it as a part of the official documentation</p>
