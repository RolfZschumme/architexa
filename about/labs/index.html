<h1>Labs - Code Understanding via Exploratory Tools</h1>

<p>At Architexa, our focus on helping developers make sense of code has shown the power of <b>diagrammatic exploration</b> tools. We have been exploring 
a number of these ideas in our labs.</p>

<li>Relo was originally inspired by the MFC Class Hierarchy Diagram, which was used to develop prototypes for work on the Microsoft Office codebase. It was then developed at MIT CSAIL and has since been significantly 
updated by Architexa.</li>
<li>Strata was originally developed at Accenture Research. It has since been refined at MIT CSAIL and been re-implemented by Architexa.</li>
<li>Chrono was originated and developed by Architexa.</li>
