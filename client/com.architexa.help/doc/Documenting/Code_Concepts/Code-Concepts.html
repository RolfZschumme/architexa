We all know that code can be difficult to document. Architexa intends on simplifying and automating much of the documentation process. Documentation can vary greatly depending on the intended audience. </p><h2 id="To_Document_a_Concept">To Document a Concept</h2><p>Take the following steps to begin documenting a code concept.</p><ol><li>Define what type of concept you are documenting and make sure to use an appropriate diagram:<ul><li>structure (layered diagram)</li><li>features </li><li>static features (class or sequence)</li><li>transport features (class or layered)</li><li>domain objects (class)</li><li>Commonly asked questions (any)</li><li>Frequently modified code sections (any)</li></ul></li><li>Break your concept into subparts if possible. Many code concepts contain either complex inheritance hierarchies or sections of #confusing loops/logic. These are perfect for breaking into separate diagrams.</li><li>Once you have a group of packages, classes, or fields/methods you can easily open them in an appropriate diagram engine.</li><li>Arrange the diagrams in an intuitive manner so that labels and connections can easily be seen.</li><li>Add comments and java doc where appropriate</li><li>It is a good practice to number comments so that there is a clear flow of information.</li></ol><h2 id="If_you_are_documenting_an_API">If you are documenting an API</h2><p>The following points are applicable if you are documenting an API that will be used by others less familiar with the source and architecture of your project.</p><ol><li>If using an example class or showing a class that is not included in the library, clearly label it as such.</li><li>API diagrams should focus on examples and be clearly understandable by those new to the library. An example of such a diagram can be found <a href="http://www.codemaps.org/groups/XTQDT6D7Hzbl/fragments/WmP6H1ROeF7Z">here</a>.</li><li>Diagrams on advanced API topics such as extending core classes etc should be targeted to readers of the appropriate skill level.</li></ol><h2 id="If_you_are_documenting_the_Core">If you are documenting the Core</h2><p>Use these tips when documenting core aspects of your project for new hires or other team members.</p><ol><li>Core diagrams should focus on important, complex, or confusing concepts in the code</li><li>Core diagrams should be targeted towards other core developers of equivalent skill level. An example of a core diagram can be found <a href="http://www.codemaps.org/groups/N8ti8o7AnrEQ/fragments/ufd2DWRmzHAk">here</a>.</li></ol><p>Depending on what diagram type(s) fit your concept the best, follow the tips below:</p><ul><li><a href="http://architexa.com/user-guide/Documenting_with_a_Layered_Diagram" title="Documenting with a Layered Diagram">Documenting with a Layered Diagram</a></li><li><a href="http://architexa.com/user-guide/Documenting_with_a_Class_Diagram" title="Documenting with a Class Diagram">Documenting with a Class Diagram</a></li><li><a href="http://architexa.com/user-guide/Documenting_with_a_Sequence_Diagram" title="Documenting with a Sequence Diagram">Documenting with a Sequence Diagram</a></li></ul><p>					---- Your question not answered?
