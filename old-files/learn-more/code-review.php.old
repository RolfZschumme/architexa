<h1>
Simplify Code Review
</h1>


<p>
Do you often spend significant time reviewing your own code or the code of others? <b>Make the code review process efficient</b> by using Architexa's integration into Subclipse and CVS to create intuitive diagrams of outgoing changes or past change sets.
</p>

<p>Architexa integrates directly into Eclipse's History and Synchronize views and Eclipse's Team context menu. We support diagram creation for both SVN and CVS repositories. Our diagrams will allow you to simultaneously view changes across multiple files and even projects, realize their impacts or inconsistencies, and quickly document changes to critical components or architecture.</p>

		<h2>Review code before committing it</h2> 
		<p>
			Under pressure to commit a critical component? Need to quickly check for bugs and inconsistencies before committing it or submitting it for review? Use Architexa to create a diagram of any outgoing changes straight from the synchronize view or the Team context menu. Create a class, sequence, or layered diagram to inspect changes from any angle. <a href="http://www.architexa.com/user-guide/Tasks/Review_your_code_changes_before_committing">Learn How</a>

		<h2>Document changes and new components</h2>
		<p>
			Has keeping documentation up-to-date become a tedious and time consuming hassle for your team? Using Architexa's team integration features will allow you to create up to date diagrams of critical code components as they are committed. 
		</p>
		<p>With Architexa you can view, download, and explore existing diagrams and documentation. You can then update these diagrams or create new ones for new or modified code components. By integrating with Eclipse's History and Synchronize views this process becomes a streamlined step in the code review and committing phase of development. 		<a href="http://www.architexa.com/user-guide/Tasks/Document_the_impact_of_recently_made_changes_to_the_code_architecture">Learn How</a>

		<h2>Review past change sets</h2>
		<p>
			As the lead of an agile team it can often be overwhelming to keep up with the staggering amount of code being changed. Without a discerning eye and a disciplined team, code architecture can easily begin to degrade and bugs will start cropping up. Instead of spending hours pouring over every line of code, you can simplify the review process by using diagrams generated by Architexa.
		</p>
		<p>When viewing revisions in Eclipse's History view, select any number of revisions to view the affected files and the impact of their modifications on the architecture. Easily find problem code in one of our diagrams: new dependencies in a layered diagram, incorrect naming conventions or inheritance hierarchies in a class diagram, or unpermitted interactions in a sequence diagram. <a href="http://www.architexa.com/user-guide/Tasks/Review_Team_Members_changes">Learn How</a>
