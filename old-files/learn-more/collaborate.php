<h1>Discuss Design and Code Fragments</h1>
<p>Is your project getting out of control? Are team members stuck in meetings arguing about aspects of the code without getting anywhere? Do they need concrete diagrams of the code to have clear design and implementation discussions? What if such diagrams can be generated with the click of a button? If they could be annotated with specific comments and shared easily across your team.</p>
<p>Architexa diagrams quickly show you the architectural descriptions of your code and also the interaction between core components - things that every developer and architect should keep an eye on. The best part is that we have made it really, really easy to generate these valuable diagrams! Architexa provides a toolbar menu directly inside Eclipse that lets you share diagrams with a single click or find and view any existing diagram with ease.
</p>
<h2>Effortless sharing</h2>
<p>Architexa makes sharing really easy by storing generated diagrams on a secure server. These diagrams can be accessed from any location. The benefits of sharing is that it encourages developers to learn aspects of the code that they are not familiar with and also it makes it very easy to have discussions around the code when you have our diagrams as a baseline to start the conversation!</p>

<h2>Mentor new developers</h2>

<p>Finding it difficult to get new developers quickly 
acquainted with your software architecture and to teach them the nuances of 
your code? Architexa helps by making it easier for senior developers to explain 
the core components to a new developer by using the diagrams made from the 
code. And it goes beyond that, developers can easily share these diagrams so 
that new developers can not only remember important parts easily but can also 
code directly with the help of such diagrams.</p>


<h2>Review code and improve architecture</h2>

<div style="float:right;">
<a href="/images/thumbnails/teamScreen.png" style="margin-left:5px;float:right" rel="prettyPhoto" title="Single-Click Sharing"><img src="/images/thumbnails/teamScreen.png" width="200" height="165" border="1" /></a>
</div>


<p>Want hassle-free code reviews? Architexa helps you create 
code diagrams which makes it much easier to discuss the code with rest of the 
team. Team members can see and understand aspects of the code that may not have 
caught their attention earlier. Such support allows for productive discussions 
around improving and refactoring existing code and leads to architecture 
improvements that teams can use to easily add unique customer-oriented 
'innovative' features.</p>	

<h2>Create groups</h2>

<div style="float:right;">

</div>

<p > Having difficulties in sharing the code highlights with 
different team members? Architexa allows you to create groups on its server for 
sharing diagrams.  This makes it much easier to share diagrams with different 
teams so that they can access the documents whenever they want.</p>
