Getting up to speed when working on relatively unfamiliar code can be hard. Architexa allows you to quickly generate helpful diagrams to start from an overview of the code and then dive into the details of it.</p><h2 id="Getting_a_High_Level_view">Getting a High Level view</h2><ol><li>Right Click on a project or jar file in the package explorer</li><li>Select Open In Layered Diagram <br/><img width="500" border="0" src="images/CreateLayerDiagram.png"/></li><li>Now you will see the top level packages containing source code. </li><li>Mouse over each package and notice the following:<ol><li>Its size relative to other packages, indicating the amount of code contained in it.</li><li>Connections going to/from it and their size (indicating the strength of the dependency)</li><li>The number of items it contains: found in the tooltip or 'more' button</li><li>The relative position of packages.
