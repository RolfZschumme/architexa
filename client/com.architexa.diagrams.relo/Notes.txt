TODO's

o Misc
 - CodeUnit => Artifact
 - Make Graph inherit from Vertex
 - DerivedCodeUnits should not inherit from CodeUnit
 - Scale
   - Private, Protected methods
   - Private, Protected, Icons
   - Large Number of Methos in a class
 - Eliminate Hacks
 - GEF Integration
   - Show menu on click not right click
   - Eliminate jiggle.Graph
   - Eliminate jiggle.JiggleObject
   - Cache distances
-------------------
o Fix Demo
 v Get realize parent working for methods
 v Get incrementality working (atleast for packages)
 v Maintain main CU's location (before and after layout) [control panning]
   v Might want to remove change of origin but instead keep the first object's 
     original location in the center
 v Inheritance lines should be orthogonal/step-wise/... not straight line
 v Track down infinite loop (in laying out)



o Test (with Relo/Jiggle)
 - Show all classes working
 v Method call's working
o Feature
 - Icon for multiple children
 - Click on icon to be able to select on a child to zoom
 - Same as above for items shown as lists (as with methods)
 - Menu's working



o Change layout of methods
o Vertical scaling (scrollbar)
o Implement call heirarchy 
	- Default rule to not show a parent
	- For other views to show one - what does this mean?
	- UI to changes between the two
o Implement support for association/reference
o Support relations with bended edges
o Figure out story about kinds of agents:
	- those that run all the time (show relationships between shown objects)
	- those that run automatically
	- that that run on selection
o Alternative agent story:
	- agent solves one kind of problem (possibly litening to multiple events)
		- e.g.: parent asserted needs to look at both addition of child and selection level changing
	- agent look at one event and does necessary tasks


v Use layout hints so that items don't move a lot
o Support scaling horizontally (layout hints as a grid)
o Support scaling vertically (scrollbar)



View Agents
v on selection, show encl.
v show common properties on anything being displayed



Agents
------
Show parent 
 - of selected
 - all parents
Show items if multiple objects points to it

> Method's should not be called if they would result in a no-op. If such 
  method's are called they will noop but also print to stderr. The only case 
  that this is not clear is whether agents should even fire, but if they do, 
  they should check before queueing commands, etc.
