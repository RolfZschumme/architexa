<li>Advantages of seeing code behavior and method call details in sequence diagrams.</li>
<li>Allowing developers to see where they are in a code base effortlessly by displaying layered architectral diagrams from the code.</li>
<li>Benefits of one click sharing of diagrams via a collaboration server.</li>
<li>Advantages of quickly switching easily between class diagrams, sequence diagrams, and layered diagrams.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Overcoming code problems <a href="sequence_test1.gif">[Sequence Diagram]</a></h2>
