Architectural cycles can cause a number of headaches for developers. Spotting them early can save a lot of time and effort when it comes time to refactor the codebase.</p><p>To spot code cycles with Architexa first</p><ol><li>Open your project in a Layered diagram</li><li>Right click anywhere in the diagram and select 'Upward Arrows' -&gt; 'Show Always'</li></ol><p>Now each of these upward arrows represents a connection between two packages that depend on each other, either directly, or through one or more other packages. To see more detail about these dependencies do the following:</p><ol><li>Hold down ctrl and left click on each of the packages you are interested in.</li><li>Right click on one of the selected packages and choose focus from the context menu</li><li>This will remove any extraneous packages and allow you to explore the relevant packages.</li><li>You can then expand the packages by double clicking and continue to keep an eye out for upward connections</li></ol><p><div class="thumb left"><div class="thumbinner" style="width:702px;"><a href="Strata-cycles.png" class="image"><img class="thumbimage" width="700" align="left" border="0" src="images/Strata-cycles.png"/></a><div class="thumbcaption">Find cycles in code</div></div></div></p><p>					---- Your question not answered?
